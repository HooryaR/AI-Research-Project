## Project Overview 
This project leveraged the PyCaret Regression module for efficient and streamlined machine learning on the White Wine dataset, focusing on predicting 'Alcohol' content. Through a comprehensive workflow, including model comparison, performance analysis, and prediction, the CatBoost Regressor emerged as the optimal model with a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2268 and a high R2 value of 0.9345. The chosen model demonstrated accurate predictions on the test set, and visualizations of residuals, errors, and feature importance further affirmed its reliability. The project highlights the efficacy of PyCaret in automating regression tasks, offering a user-friendly approach to model selection and deployment, ultimately resulting in a robust and accurate predictive model for the target variable.

## Results and Findings
The machine learning workflow utilized PyCaret, with models like CatBoost Regressor standing out as top performers. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric was chosen to evaluate model performance. The findings indicate that PyCaret is an effective tool for automating regression tasks, with the CatBoost Regressor delivering superior results in predicting alcohol content. The inclusion of quality as a feature provided additional insights into the relationship between wine attributes and overall quality.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and comprises features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and quality. The target variable is alcohol content. The quality feature provides a rating of the wine. This information is crucial for understanding the factors influencing alcohol content and overall quality.
